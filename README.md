# CSIS-10A Final Project -- 

Two projects are included in this section. The first one deals with waves and the second one is a first attempt to simplify algebraic expressions.

## [1] Waves.

There are two versions for the project dealing with waves. In the first instance, I wrote Java code for a low-resolution model that uses the gridworld classes. All new classes extending the gridworld classes are located in this folder. Class WaveRunner is the driver for classes BoundarySpot and Wavelike.

On the other hand, a model with improved graphical resolution (thanks to JavaFX) was created and is located in folder src. There are three classes, WaterBlobs, Lake, and Spot, the first two being independent drivers for the model. The only difference between them is that WaterBlobs allows the user to activate waves with a mouse click. The class Spot defines a wave as a perturbation of the color of the environment ("the lake").

## [2] Algebrator.

Based on class Term, this project is aimed to simplify algebraic expressions by looking at the form of both the coefficients and the variables. Just run class Algebrator to start playing with algebraic expressions.

Have fun!
