# CSIS-10A Final Project -- some ideas

## [1] Waves.

I would like to create a program that simulates a wave traveling across the screen.
Even though the mathematical framework could be complicated, I think there are simple ways to compute the distribution of temperature, for example, throughout a rectangle-shaped area given the initial state and the boundary conditions.

The difficulty I see for this case is how to change the color of every pixel in my screen as a function of my variable of interest (temp) and how to get the coordinates of the location where the user clicks the mouse.

## [2] Tunnel.

I would be interested in drawing a tunnel in perspective simulating the view a user would have when driving a car inside of the tunnel.
The user might control the speed at which he or she approaches the tunnel.

## [3] Simplifying algebraic expressions.

This might be a command line program for the user to input an algebraic expression to be simplified.
